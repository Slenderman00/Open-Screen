With the power of modern technology Open Screen replaces your boring background with whatever you need!

## Description
Open Screen creates a virtual camera that monitors for activity. Once an application connects to the virtual camera, Open Screen then connects to your actual camera and initiates the background replacement.

Open screen relies on [v4l2loopback-dkms](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback) to create the virtual camera 
```
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1
```

To start open screen run the followin command. 

```
openscreen
```
Settings can be edited by running 
```
openscreen --settings
```
The following settings are available
```
[general]
flip_image = false
real_camera = 0
fake_camera = 2
depth_scale = 0.3
threshold_offset = 4
background = "/home/.../stock.png"

```
